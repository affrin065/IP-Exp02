<h3>IT</H3>
<p>Stanford University was founded in 1885 by California senator Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, “to promote the public welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of humanity and civilization.”
When railroad magnate and former California Gov. Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford, lost their only child, Leland, Jr., to typhoid in 1884, they decided to build a university as the most fitting memorial, and deeded to it a large fortune that included the 8,180-acre Palo Alto stock farm that became the campus. The campus is located within the traditional territory of the Muwekma Ohlone Tribe.  The Stanfords made their plans just as the modern research university was taking form.

Leland Stanford Junior University – still its legal name – opened Oct. 1, 1891.

The Stanfords and founding President David Starr Jordan aimed for their new university to be nonsectarian, co-educational and affordable, to produce cultured and useful graduates, and to teach both the traditional liberal arts and the technology and engineering that were already changing America.

Their vision took shape on the oak-dotted fields of the San Francisco Peninsula as a matrix of arcades and quadrangles designed for expansion and the dissolving of barriers between people, disciplines and ideas.

<h3>ECE</H3>
<p>Welcome to the SLAC Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering!!!
USC began teaching electrical engineering more than a century ago, when the field was widely considered a subset of physics. Today our work is vitally important and critical to the advancement of the information age. As our department charges into its second century of excellence, we are defining the forefront of research in a number of important areas. These include: circuits; antenna networks; bio-signal processing; computer architecture; very large-scale integration and computer-aided design; computer networks; control systems; high-speed switching architectures; signal, image and multimedia processing; nanotechnology; optical communications; photonics; and quantum information processing...
We’re proud of our department’s distinguished history and our vital and innovative faculty. ”</p>
